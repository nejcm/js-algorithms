Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a\[i\] ≤ _n_ (_n_ = size of array), some elements
appear twice and others appear once.

Find all the elements of \[1, _n_\] inclusive that do not appear in this array.

Could you do it without extra space and in O(_n_) runtime? You may assume the returned
list does not count as extra space.

**Example:**

    Input:
    [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]

    Output:
    [5,6]
