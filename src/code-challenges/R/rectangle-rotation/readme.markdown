A rectangle with sides equal to even integers `a` and `b` is drawn on the Cartesian plane.
Its center (the intersection point of its diagonals) coincides with the point `(0, 0)`,
but the sides of the rectangle are not parallel to the axes; instead, they are forming
`45` degree angles with the axes.

How many points with integer coordinates are located inside the given rectangle (including
on its sides)?

Example

For `a = 6` and `b = 4`, the output should be  
`rectangleRotation(a, b) = 23`.

The following picture illustrates the example, and the `23` points are marked green.

    // Prints help message to the console
    // Returns a string
    function helloWorld(name) {
        console.log("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
        return "Hello, " + name;
    }
