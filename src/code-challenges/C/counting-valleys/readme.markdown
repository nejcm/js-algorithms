Gary is an avid hiker. He tracks his hikes meticulously, paying close attention to small
details like topography. During his last hike he took exactly steps. For every step he
took, he noted if it was an _uphill_, , or a _downhill_, step. Gary's hikes start and end
at sea level and each step up or down represents a unit change in altitude. We define the
following terms:

- A _mountain_ is a sequence of consecutive steps _above_ sea level, starting with a step
  _up_ from sea level and ending with a step _down_ to sea level.
- A _valley_ is a sequence of consecutive steps _below_ sea level, starting with a step
  _down_ from sea level and ending with a step _up_ to sea level.

Given Gary's sequence of _up_ and _down_ steps during his last hike, find and print the
number of _valleys_ he walked through.

For example, if Gary's path is , he first enters a valley units deep. Then he climbs out
an up onto a mountain units high. Finally, he returns to sea level and ends his hike.

**Function Description**

Complete the _countingValleys_ function in the editor below. It must return an integer
that denotes the number of valleys Gary traversed.

countingValleys has the following parameter(s):

- _n_: the number of steps Gary takes
- _s_: a string describing his path

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer , the number of steps in Gary's hike.  
The second line contains a single string , of characters that describe his path.

**Constraints**

**Output Format**

Print a single integer that denotes the number of valleys Gary walked through during his
hike.

**Sample Input**

    8
    UDDDUDUU

**Sample Output**

    1

**Explanation**

If we represent `_` as sea level, a step up as `/`, and a step down as `\`, Gary's hike
can be drawn as:

    _/\      _
       \    /
        \/\/

He enters and leaves one valley.
