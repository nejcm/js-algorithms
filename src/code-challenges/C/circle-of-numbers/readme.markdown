Consider integer numbers from `0` to `n - 1` written down along the circle in such a way
that the distance between any two neighboring numbers is equal (note that `0` and `n - 1`
are neighboring, too).

Given `n` and `firstNumber`, find the number which is written in the radially opposite
position to `firstNumber`.

Example

For `n = 10` and `firstNumber = 2`, the output should be  
`circleOfNumbers(n, firstNumber) = 7`.

    // Prints help message to the console
    // Returns a string
    function helloWorld(name) {
        console.log("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
        return "Hello, " + name;
    }
