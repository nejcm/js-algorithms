You've intercepted an encrypted message, and you are really curious about its contents.
You were able to find out that the message initially contained only lowercase English
letters, and was encrypted with the following cipher:

- Let all letters from `'a'` to `'z'` correspond to the numbers from `0` to `25`,
  respectively.
- The number corresponding to the `ith` letter of the encrypted message is then equal to
  the sum of numbers corresponding to the first `i` letters of the initial unencrypted
  `message` _modulo 26_.

Now that you know how the `message` was encrypted, implement the algorithm to decipher it.

Example

For `message = "taiaiaertkixquxjnfxxdh"`, the output should be  
`cipher26(message) = "thisisencryptedmessage"`.

The initial message `"thisisencryptedmessage"` was encrypted as follows:

- letter `0`: `t -> 19 -> t`;
- letter `1`: `th -> (19 + 7) % 26 -> 0 -> a`;
- letter `2`: `thi -> (19 + 7 + 8) % 26 -> 8 -> i`;
- etc.

Input/Output

  _Guaranteed constraints:_  
  `1 ≤ message.length ≤ 200`.

- **\[output\] string**

  - A decrypted message.

    // Prints help message to the console
    // Returns a string
    function helloWorld(name) {
        console.log("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
        return "Hello, " + name;
    }
