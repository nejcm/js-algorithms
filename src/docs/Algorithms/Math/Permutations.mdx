# Permutations

A permutation of a set is, loosely speaking, an arrangement of its members into a sequence
or linear order, or if the set is already ordered, a rearrangement of its elements. The
word "permutation" also refers to the act or process of changing the linear order of an
ordered set.

Permutations differ from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set
regardless of order. For example, written as tuples, there are six permutations of the set
{1,2,3}, namely: (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1). These are all
the possible orderings of this three-element set. Anagrams of words whose letters are
different are also permutations: the letters are already ordered in the original word, and
the anagram is a reordering of the letters. The study of permutations of finite sets is an
important topic in the fields of combinatorics and group theory.

The number of permutations of n distinct objects is n factorial, usually written as
n!which means the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.. [Source:
