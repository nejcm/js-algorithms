# Knuth Morris Pratt

Knuth–Morris–Pratt string-searching algorithm (or KMP algorithm) searches for
occurrences of a "word" W within a main "text string" S by employing the
observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient
information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing
re-examination of previously matched characters. (Source: Wikipedia)

\* Where n = length of the source; m = length of the query pattern; k = size of
the Alphabet
