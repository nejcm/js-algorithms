# Naive algorithm

The naive approach to the string matching problem is walking through the source
starting from the beginning and checking at each position if the resulting
substring equals the query pattern. While being inefficient, it may be
beneficial to use it in cases where the speed advantage of another algorithm is
neglegible or does not outhweigh the additional setup needed (for example if
your source and query pattern are really short). (Source: Wikipedia)

## Complexity

| Name            | Preprocessing | Average |   Worst    | Space | Comments |
| --------------- | :-----------: | :-----: | :--------: | :---: | :------- |
| Naive algorithm |     none      |  n\*m   | m\*(n-m+1) | none  |          |

\* Where n = length of the source; m = length of the query pattern; k = size of
the Alphabet
