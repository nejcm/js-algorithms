# Boyer Moore

Boyer–Moore string-search algorithm is an efficient string-searching algorithm that is the
standard benchmark for practical string-search literature. It was developed by Robert S.
Boyer and J Strother Moore in 1977. The algorithm preprocesses the string being searched
for (the pattern), but not the string being searched in (the text). It is thus well-suited
for applications in which the pattern is much shorter than the text or where it persists
across multiple searches. The Boyer–Moore algorithm uses information gathered during the
preprocess step to skip sections of the text, resulting in a lower constant factor than
many other string search algorithms. In general, the algorithm runs faster as the pattern
length increases. The key features of the algorithm are to match on the tail of the
pattern rather than the head, and to skip along the text in jumps of multiple characters
rather than searching every single character in the text. (Source: Wikipedia)
