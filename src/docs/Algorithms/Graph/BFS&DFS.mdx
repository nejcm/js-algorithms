# BFS & DFS

## Breadth first search

BFS (level order traversal) is a vertex based technique for finding a shortest path in
graph. It uses a Queue data structure which follows first in first out. In BFS, one vertex
is selected at a time when it is visited and marked then its adjacent are visited and
stored in the queue. It is slower than DFS. [Source: Geeksforgeeks]

It starts traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and traverse the graph
layerwise thus exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source
node). You must then move towards the next-level neighbour nodes.

## Depth first search

DFS is a edge based technique. It uses the Stack data structure, performs two stages,
first visited vertices are pushed into stack and second if there is no vertices then
visited vertices are popped.

The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the idea of backtracking. It involves
exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead, if possible, else by backtracking.
