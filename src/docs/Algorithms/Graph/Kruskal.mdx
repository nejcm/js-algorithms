# Kruskal

Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of
the least possible weight that connects any two trees in the forest. It is a
greedy algorithm in graph theory as it finds a minimum spanning tree for a
connected weighted graph adding increasing cost arcs at each step. This means it
finds a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where
the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized. If the graph is not
connected, then it finds a minimum spanning forest (a minimum spanning tree for
each connected component). [Source: Wikipedia]
