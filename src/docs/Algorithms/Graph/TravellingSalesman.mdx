# Travelling salesman problem

The travelling salesman problem (also called the travelling salesperson problem or TSP)
asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair
of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the
origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in
theoretical computer science and operations research.

The travelling purchaser problem and the vehicle routing problem are both generalizations
of TSP.

In the theory of computational complexity, the decision version of the TSP (where given a
length L, the task is to decide whether the graph has a tour of at most L) belongs to the
class of NP-complete problems. Thus, it is possible that the worst-case running time for
any algorithm for the TSP increases superpolynomially (but no more than exponentially)
with the number of cities. [Source: Wikipedia]
