# Prim

Prim's (also known as Jarník's) algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum
spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. This means it finds a subset of the edges
that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in
the tree is minimized. The algorithm operates by building this tree one vertex at a time,
from an arbitrary starting vertex, at each step adding the cheapest possible connection
from the tree to another vertex.

Other well-known algorithms for this problem include Kruskal's algorithm and Borůvka's
algorithm. These algorithms find the minimum spanning forest in a possibly disconnected
graph; in contrast, the most basic form of Prim's algorithm only finds minimum spanning
trees in connected graphs. However, running Prim's algorithm separately for each connected
component of the graph, it can also be used to find the minimum spanning forest. In terms
of their asymptotic time complexity, these three algorithms are equally fast for sparse
graphs, but slower than other more sophisticated algorithms. However, for graphs that are
sufficiently dense, Prim's algorithm can be made to run in linear time, meeting or
improving the time bounds for other algorithms. [Source: Wikipedia]

## Minimum Spanning Tree

A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of
a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together,
without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. That is, it is a
spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible. More generally, any
edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest,
which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its connected components. [Source:
