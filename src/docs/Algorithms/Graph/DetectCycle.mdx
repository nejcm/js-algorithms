# Detect cycle

In graph theory, a cycle in a graph is a non-empty trail in which the only repeated
vertices are the first and last vertices. A directed cycle in a directed graph is a
non-empty directed trail in which the only repeated vertices are the first and last
vertices.

A graph without cycles is called an acyclic graph. A directed graph without directed
cycles is called a directed acyclic graph. A connected graph without cycles is called a
tree. [Source: Wikipedia]
