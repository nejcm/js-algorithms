# Hamiltonian cycle

Hamiltonian path (or traceable path) is a path in an undirected or directed graph that
visits each vertex exactly once. A Hamiltonian cycle (or Hamiltonian circuit) is a
Hamiltonian path that is a cycle. Determining whether such paths and cycles exist in
graphs is the Hamiltonian path problem, which is NP-complete.

The Hamiltonian cycle problem is a special case of the travelling salesman problem,
obtained by setting the distance between two cities to one if they are adjacent and two
otherwise, and verifying that the total distance travelled is equal to n (if so, the route
is a Hamiltonian circuit; if there is no Hamiltonian circuit then the shortest route will
be longer). [Source: Wikipedia]
