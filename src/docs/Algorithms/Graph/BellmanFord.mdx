# Bellman ford

It is an algorithm that computes shortest paths from a single source vertex to
all of the other vertices in a weighted digraph. It is slower than Dijkstra's
algorithm for the same problem, but more versatile, as it is capable of handling
graphs in which some of the edge weights are negative numbers.

Negative edge weights are found in various applications of graphs, hence the
usefulness of this algorithm. If a graph contains a "negative cycle" (i.e. a
cycle whose edges sum to a negative value) that is reachable from the source,
then there is no cheapest path: any path that has a point on the negative cycle
can be made cheaper by one more walk around the negative cycle. In such a case,
the Bellman–Ford algorithm can detect and report the negative cycle.

Like Dijkstra's algorithm, Bellman–Ford proceeds by relaxation, in which
approximations to the correct distance are replaced by better ones until they
eventually reach the solution. In both algorithms, the approximate distance to
each vertex is always an overestimate of the true distance, and is replaced by
the minimum of its old value and the length of a newly found path. However,
Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue to greedily select the closest vertex
that has not yet been processed, and performs this relaxation process on all of
its outgoing edges; by contrast, the Bellman–Ford algorithm simply relaxes all
the edges. In each of these repetitions, the number of vertices with correctly
calculated distances grows, from which it follows that eventually all vertices
will have their correct distances. This method allows the Bellman–Ford algorithm
to be applied to a wider class of inputs than Dijkstra. [Source: Wikipedia]
