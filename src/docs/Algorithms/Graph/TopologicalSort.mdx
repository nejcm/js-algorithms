# Topological sort

Or topological ordering of a directed graph is a linear ordering of its vertices
such that for every directed edge uv from vertex u to vertex v, u comes before v
in the ordering. For instance, the vertices of the graph may represent tasks to
be performed, and the edges may represent constraints that one task must be
performed before another; in this application, a topological ordering is just a
valid sequence for the tasks. A topological ordering is possible if and only if
the graph has no directed cycles, that is, if it is a directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Any DAG has at least one topological ordering, and algorithms are known
for constructing a topological ordering of any DAG in linear time. [Source:

The graph shown above has many valid topological sorts:

- `5, 7, 3, 11, 8, 2, 9, 10` (visual left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- `3, 5, 7, 8, 11, 2, 9, 10` (smallest-numbered available vertex first)
- `5, 7, 3, 8, 11, 10, 9, 2` (fewest edges first)
- `7, 5, 11, 3, 10, 8, 9, 2` (largest-numbered available vertex first)
- `5, 7, 11, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10` (attempting top-to-bottom, left-to-right)
- `3, 7, 8, 5, 11, 10, 2, 9` (arbitrary)
