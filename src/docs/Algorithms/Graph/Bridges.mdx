# Bridges

In graph theory, a bridge, isthmus, cut-edge, or cut arc is an edge of a graph
whose deletion increases its number of connected components. Equivalently, an
edge is a bridge if and only if it is not contained in any cycle. For a
connected graph, a bridge can uniquely determine a cut. A graph is said to be
bridgeless or isthmus-free if it contains no bridges.

Another meaning of "bridge" appears in the term bridge of a subgraph. If H is a
subgraph of G, a bridge of H in G is a maximal subgraph of G that is not
contained in H and is not separated by H. [Source: Wikipedia]
