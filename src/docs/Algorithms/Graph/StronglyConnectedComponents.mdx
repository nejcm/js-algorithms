# Strongly connected components

A graph is said to be strongly connected if every vertex is reachable from every other
vertex. The strongly connected components of an arbitrary directed graph form a partition
into subgraphs that are themselves strongly connected. It is possible to test the strong
connectivity of a graph, or to find its strongly connected components, in linear time.

A directed graph is called strongly connected if there is a path in each direction between
each pair of vertices of the graph. That is, a path exists from the first vertex in the
pair to the second, and another path exists from the second vertex to the first. In a
directed graph G that may not itself be strongly connected, a pair of vertices u and v are
said to be strongly connected to each other if there is a path in each direction between
them. [Source: Wikipedia]

\* Where v = number of visited vertices; e = number of visited edges  
\* Where b = branching factor of the tree/graph, d = depth of the goal node.
