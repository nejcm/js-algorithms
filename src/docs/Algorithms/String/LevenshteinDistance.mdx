# Levenshtein distance

n information theory, linguistics and computer science, the Levenshtein distance
is a string metric for measuring the difference between two sequences.
Informally, the Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of
single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to
change one word into the other. (Source: Wikipedia)
