# Interpolation Search

Interpolation search is an algorithm for searching for a key in an array that
has been ordered by numerical values assigned to the keys (key values). It was
first described by W. W. Peterson in 1957. Interpolation search resembles the
method by which people search a telephone directory for a name (the key value by
which the book's entries are ordered): in each step the algorithm calculates
where in the remaining search space the sought item might be, based on the key
values at the bounds of the search space and the value of the sought key,
usually via a linear interpolation. The key value actually found at this
estimated position is then compared to the key value being sought. If it is not
equal, then depending on the comparison, the remaining search space is reduced
to the part before or after the estimated position. This method will only work
if calculations on the size of differences between key values are sensible.

By comparison, binary search always chooses the middle of the remaining search
space, discarding one half or the other, depending on the comparison between the
key found at the estimated position and the key sought â€” it does not require
numerical values for the keys, just a total order on them. The remaining search
space is reduced to the part before or after the estimated position. The linear
search uses equality only as it compares elements one-by-one from the start,
ignoring any sorting. (Source: Wikipedia)
