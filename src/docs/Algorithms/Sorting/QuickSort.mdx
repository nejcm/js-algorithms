# Quick Sort

Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm.
When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main
competitors, merge sort and heapsort.

Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from
the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether
they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the
sorting.

Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a
"less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. Efficient implementations of
Quicksort are not a stable sort, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is
not preserved.
