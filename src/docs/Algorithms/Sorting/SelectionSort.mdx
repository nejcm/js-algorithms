# Selection Sort

Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm. It has an O(n2) time
complexity, which makes it inefficient on large lists, and generally performs
worse than the similar insertion sort. Selection sort is noted for its
simplicity and has performance advantages over more complicated algorithms in
certain situations, particularly where auxiliary memory is limited.

The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items
which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a
sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.
Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire
input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest,
depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging
(swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order),
and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

The time efficiency of selection sort is quadratic, so there are a number of
sorting techniques which have better time complexity than selection sort. One
thing which distinguishes selection sort from other sorting algorithms is that
it makes the minimum possible number of swaps, n âˆ’ 1 in the worst case.(Source:
