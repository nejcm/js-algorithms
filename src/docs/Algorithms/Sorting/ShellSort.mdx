# Shell Sort

Also known as Shell sort or Shell's method, is an in-place comparison sort. It
can be seen as either a generalization of sorting by exchange (bubble sort) or
sorting by insertion (insertion sort). The method starts by sorting pairs of
elements far apart from each other, then progressively reducing the gap between
elements to be compared. By starting with far apart elements, it can move some
out-of-place elements into position faster than a simple nearest neighbor
exchange. Donald Shell published the first version of this sort in 1959. The
running time of Shellsort is heavily dependent on the gap sequence it uses. For
many practical variants, determining their time complexity remains an open
problem. (Source: Wikipedia)
