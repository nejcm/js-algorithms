# Counting Sort

In computer science, counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects
according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It
operates by counting the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using
arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output
sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference between the
maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where
the variation in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items. However, it
is often used as a subroutine in another sorting algorithm, radix sort, that can handle
larger keys more efficiently. (Source: Wikipedia)

## Pseudocode

```bash
count = array of k+1 zeros
for x in input do
    count[key(x)] += 1

total = 0
for i in 0, 1, ... k do
    count[i], total = total, count[i] + total

output = array of the same length as input
for x in input do
    output[count[key(x)]] = x
    count[key(x)] += 1

return output
```
