# Merge Sort

In computer science, merge sort (also commonly spelled mergesort) is an
efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most
implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal
elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer
algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. Conceptually, a merge
sort works as follows (Source: Wikipedia):

- Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list
  of one element is considered sorted).
- Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only
  one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

A recursive merge sort algorithm used to sort an array of 7 integer values.
These are the steps a human would take to emulate merge sort (top-down).
