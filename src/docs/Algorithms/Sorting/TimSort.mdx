# Tim Sort

Timsort is a hybrid stable sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and
insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It
was implemented by Tim Peters in 2002 for use in the Python programming
language. The algorithm finds subsequences of the data that are already ordered
(runs) and uses them to sort the remainder more efficiently. This is done by
merging runs until certain criteria are fulfilled. (Source: Wikipedia)

We divide the Array into blocks known as Run. We sort those runs using insertion
sort one by one and then merge those runs using combine function used in merge
sort. If the size of Array is less than run, then Array get sorted just by using
Insertion Sort. The size of run may vary from 32 to 64 depending upon the size
of the array. Note that merge function performs well when sizes subarrays are
powers of 2. The idea is based on the fact that insertion sort performs well for
small arrays. (Source: Geeksforgeeks)
