# Bubble Sort

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting
algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each
pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order (ascending
or descending arrangement). The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps
are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

This simple algorithm performs poorly in real world use and is used primarily as
an educational tool. More efficient algorithms such as timsort, or merge sort
are used by the sorting libraries built into popular programming languages such
as Python and Java. (Source: Wikipedia)
