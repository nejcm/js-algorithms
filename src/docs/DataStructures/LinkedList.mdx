# Linked list

Is a linear collection of data elements, whose order is not given by their
physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a
data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a
sequence. In its most basic form, each node contains: data, and a reference (in
other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for
efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence
during iteration. More complex variants add additional links, allowing more
efficient insertion or removal of nodes at arbitrary positions. A drawback of
linked lists is that access time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster
access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays have better cache
locality compared to linked lists.

Linked lists are among the simplest and most common data structures. They can be
used to implement several other common abstract data types, including lists,
stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions, though it is not uncommon
to implement those data structures directly without using a linked list as the
basis.

Disadvantages:

- They use more memory than arrays because of the storage used by their
  pointers.
- Nodes in a linked list must be read in order from the beginning as linked
  lists are inherently sequential access.
- Nodes are stored noncontiguously, greatly increasing the time periods required
  to access individual elements within the list, especially with a CPU cache.
- Difficulties arise in linked lists when it comes to reverse traversing. For
  instance, singly-linked lists are cumbersome to navigate backward [1] and
  while doubly linked lists are somewhat easier to read, memory is consumed in
  allocating space for a back-pointer.
