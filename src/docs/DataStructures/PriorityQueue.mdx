# Priority queue

Is an abstract data type similar to regular queue or stack data structure in
which each element additionally has a "priority" associated with it. In a
priority queue, an element with high priority is served before an element with
low priority. In some implementations, if two elements have the same priority,
they are served according to the order in which they were enqueued, while in
other implementations, ordering of elements with the same priority is undefined.

While priority queues are often implemented with heaps, they are conceptually
distinct from heaps. A priority queue is a concept like "a list" or "a map";
just as a list can be implemented with a linked list or an array, a priority
queue can be implemented with a heap or a variety of other methods such as an
unordered array. (Source: Wikipedia)
