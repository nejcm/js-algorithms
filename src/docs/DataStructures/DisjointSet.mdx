# Disjoint-set

A disjoint-set data structure (also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set)
is a data structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint
(non-overlapping) subsets. It provides near-constant-time operations (bounded by the
inverse Ackermann function) to add new sets, to merge existing sets, and to determine
whether elements are in the same set. In addition to many other uses (see the Applications
section), disjoint-sets play a key role in Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum
spanning tree of a graph. (Source: Wikipedia)

_MakeSet_ creates 8 singletons.

After some operations of _Union_, some sets are grouped together.
