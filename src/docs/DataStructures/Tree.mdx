# Tree

is a widely used abstract data type (ADT) that simulates a hierarchical tree
structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node,
represented as a set of linked nodes.

A tree data structure can be defined recursively as a collection of nodes
(starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a
value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the
constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.

Alternatively, a tree can be defined abstractly as a whole (globally) as an
ordered tree, with a value assigned to each node. Both these perspectives are
useful: while a tree can be analyzed mathematically as a whole, when actually
represented as a data structure it is usually represented and worked with
separately by node (rather than as a set of nodes and an adjacency list of edges
between nodes, as one may represent a digraph, for instance). For example,
looking at a tree as a whole, one can talk about "the parent node" of a given
node, but in general as a data structure a given node only contains the list of
its children, but does not contain a reference to its parent (if any). (Source:

### Some tree types:

1. **Binary Tree**: This is the most basic basic from of tree structure. Where
   each node can have utmost two children. A perfect binary tree is a binary
   tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the
   same depth or same level. A full binary tree (sometimes referred to as a
   proper or plane binary tree) is a tree in which every node in the tree has
   either 0 or 2 children. In a complete binary tree every level, except
   possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are
   as far left as possible. In the infinite complete binary tree, every node has
   two children.
2. **Binary search tree**: BST is a binary tree with certain properties such as
   , and left child of the given node contains value less than equal to the
   given node and right hand child contain node greater than the given node.
3. **AVL tree or height balanced binary tree**: It is a variation of the Binary
   tree where height difference between left and right sub tree can be at
   most 1. If at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to
   restore this property. Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log n) time
   in both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of nodes in the
   tree prior to the operation.
4. **Red-Black tree**: Another variant of binary tree similar to AVL tree it is
   a self balancing binary search tree. In this tree nodes are either colored
   red or black.
5. **Splay tree**: A splay tree is a self-adjusting binary search tree with the
   additional property that recently accessed elements are quick to access
   again. All normal operations on a binary search tree are combined with one
   basic operation, called splaying. Splaying the tree for a certain element
   rearranges the tree so that the element is placed at the root of the tree.
6. **N-ary tree**: In this tree the limitation of the binary tree is removed.
   Here a node can have at most n children. Like binary tree it can be
   full,complete or perfect n-ary tree. N-ary is some time known as forest.
7. **Fenwick tree**: Is a binary indexed tree is a data structure that can
   efficiently update elements and calculate prefix sums in a table of numbers.
8. **Trie Structure**: In computer science, a trie, also called digital tree and
   sometimes radix tree or prefix tree (as they can be searched by prefixes), is
   an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or
   associative array where the keys are usually strings. All the descendants of
   a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the
   root is associated with the empty string.
9. **Suffix tree**: Trie and suffix tree are closely related. a suffix tree
   (also called PAT tree or, in an earlier form, position tree) is a compressed
   trie containing all the suffixes of the given text as their keys and
   positions in the text as their values. Suffix trees allow particularly fast
   implementations of many important string operations.
10. **Huffman Tree**: Huffman tree is a frequency sorted binary tree used widely
    in compressing data. Huffman tree is constructed to allocate a short code
    word to a long text based on its frequency of occurrences.
11. **Heap Structure**: Heap structure is another widely used tree structure
    with a specific ordering property. There are two types of heap - Min heap
    and Max heap. In a min heap the parent of a node must be smaller than the
    values of all its children. Similarly in max heap the parent always have
    greater value compared to all its children. One common implementation of
    heap is Binary heap where each parent can have at most two children.
