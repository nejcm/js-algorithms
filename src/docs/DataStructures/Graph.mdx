# Graph

Is an abstract data type that is meant to implement the undirected graph and
directed graph concepts from the field of graph theory within mathematics.

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of
vertices (also called nodes or points), together with a set of unordered pairs
of these vertices for an undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a
directed graph. These pairs are known as edges (also called links or lines), and
for a directed graph are also known as arrows. The vertices may be part of the
graph structure, or may be external entities represented by integer indices or
references.

A graph data structure may also associate to each edge some edge value, such as
a symbolic label or a numeric attribute (cost, capacity, length, etc.). (Source:
