# Hash table

A hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array
abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a
hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of
buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the
key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is
stored.

Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most
hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash
collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one
key. Such collisions are always accommodated in some way.

In a well-dimensioned hash table, the average cost (number of instructions) for
each lookup is independent of the number of elements stored in the table. Many
hash table designs also allow arbitrary insertions and deletions of key-value
pairs, at (amortized) constant average cost per operation.

In many situations, hash tables turn out to be on average more efficient than
search trees or any other table lookup structure. For this reason, they are
widely used in many kinds of computer software, particularly for associative
arrays, database indexing, caches, and sets. (Source: Wikipedia)
