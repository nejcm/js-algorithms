# Binary search

Also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search
algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search
compares the target value to the middle element of the array. If they are not equal, the
half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the
remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value, and
repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half
being empty, the target is not in the array. (Source: Wikipedia)
