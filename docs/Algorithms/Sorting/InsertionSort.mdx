# Insertion Sort

[View the implementation](https://github.com/nejcm/js-algorithms/blob/master/src/algorithms/sorting/insertion-sort/index.ts)


Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array (or list)
one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms
such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. (Source: Wikipedia)

It iterates the input elements by growing the sorted array at each iteration. It compares
the current element with the largest value in the sorted array. If the current element is
greater, then it leaves the element in its place and moves on to the next element else it
finds its correct position in the sorted array and moves it to that position. This is done
by shifting all the elements, which are larger than the current element, in the sorted
array to one position ahead. (Source: hackerearth)
