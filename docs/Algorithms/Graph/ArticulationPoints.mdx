# Articulation Points

[View the implementation](https://github.com/nejcm/js-algorithms/blob/master/src/algorithms/graph/articulation-points/index.ts)

A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) if
removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph. Articulation points represent
vulnerabilities in a connected network â€“ single points whose failure would split the
network into 2 or more components. They are useful for designing reliable networks. For a
disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a vertex removing which increases
number of connected components. [Source: Geeksforgeeks]
