# Factorial

[View the implementation](https://github.com/nejcm/js-algorithms/blob/master/src/algorithms/math/factorial/index.ts)

In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of
all positive integers less than or equal to n: n! = n × (n−1) × (n−2) × ... × 2 × 1. The
value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.

The factorial operation is encountered in many areas of mathematics, notably in
combinatorics, algebra, and mathematical analysis. Its most basic use counts the possible
distinct sequences – the permutations – of n distinct objects: there are n!. [Source:
