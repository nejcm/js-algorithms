# Knapsack problem

The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items,
each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a
collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total
value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who
is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. The
problem often arises in resource allocation where the decision makers have to choose from
a set of non-divisible projects or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint,
respectively. [Source: Wikipedia]

The knapsack problem is interesting from the perspective of computer science for many
reasons:

- The decision problem form of the knapsack problem (Can a value of at least V be achieved
  without exceeding the weight W?) is NP-complete, thus there is no known algorithm both
  correct and fast (polynomial-time) in all cases.
- While the decision problem is NP-complete, the optimization problem is NP-hard, its
  resolution is at least as difficult as the decision problem, and there is no known
  polynomial algorithm which can tell, given a solution, whether it is optimal (which
  would mean that there is no solution with a larger V, thus solving the NP-complete
  decision problem).
- There is a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm using dynamic programming.
- There is a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme, which uses the pseudo-polynomial
  time algorithm as a subroutine, described below.
- Many cases that arise in practice, and "random instances" from some distributions, can
  nonetheless be solved exactly.
