# Bloom filter

A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, conceived by Burton
Howard Bloom in 1970, that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set. False
positive matches are possible, but false negatives are not â€“ in other words, a query
returns either "possibly in set" or "definitely not in set." Elements can be added to the
set, but not removed (though this can be addressed with the counting Bloom filter
variant); the more items added, the larger the probability of false positives. (Source:
