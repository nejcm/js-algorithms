# Stack

A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two
principal operations:

- **push**, which adds an element to the collection;
- **pop**, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed;

The order in which elements come off a stack gives rise to its alternative name, LIFO
(last in, first out). Additionally, a peek operation may give access to the top without
modifying the stack. The name "stack" for this type of structure comes from the analogy to
a set of physical items stacked on top of each other. This structure makes it easy to take
an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require
taking off multiple other items first. (Source: Wikipedia)
