# Queue

Is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the
addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other
end of the sequence. By convention, the end of the sequence at which elements are added is
called the back, tail, or rear of the queue, and the end at which elements are removed is
called the head or front of the queue, analogously to the words used when people line up
to wait for goods or services.

The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as enqueue, and the
operation of removing an element from the front is known as dequeue. Other operations may
also be allowed, often including a peek or front operation that returns the value of the
next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.

The operations of a queue make it a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure. In a FIFO
data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
This is equivalent to the requirement that once a new element is added, all elements that
were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed. A queue is an
example of a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection. Queues are
common in computer programs, where they are implemented as data structures coupled with
access routines, as an abstract data structure or in object-oriented languages as classes.
Common implementations are circular buffers and linked lists.

Queues provide services in computer science, transport, and operations research where
various entities such as data, objects, persons, or events are stored and held to be
processed later. In these contexts, the queue performs the function of a buffer. Another
usage of queues is in the implementation of breadth-first search. (Source: Wikipedia)
