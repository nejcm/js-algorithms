# Trie

Also called digital tree or prefix tree, is a kind of search treeâ€”an ordered tree data
structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually
strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with
that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated;
i.e., the value of the key is distributed across the structure. All the descendants of a
node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is
associated with the empty string. Keys tend to be associated with leaves, though some
inner nodes may correspond to keys of interest. Hence, keys are not necessarily associated
with every node. For the space-optimized presentation of prefix tree, see compact prefix
tree.

In the example shown, keys are listed in the nodes and values below them. Each complete
English word has an arbitrary integer value associated with it. A trie can be seen as a
tree-shaped deterministic finite automaton. Each finite language is generated by a trie
automaton, and each trie can be compressed into a deterministic acyclic finite state
automaton.

Though tries can be keyed by character strings, they need not be. The same algorithms can
be adapted to serve similar functions on ordered lists of any construct; e.g.,
permutations on a list of digits or shapes. In particular, a bitwise trie is keyed on the
individual bits making up any fixed-length binary datum, such as an integer or memory
address. (Source: Wikipedia)
